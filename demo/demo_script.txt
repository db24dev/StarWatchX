StarWatchX Demo Script
======================

Demo Overview:
--------------
This demo showcases the real-time object detection and tracking capabilities
of StarWatchX, including trajectory prediction and telemetry visualization.

Demo Steps:
-----------

1. System Startup
   - Start Java engine: `cd java-engine && java -jar starwatchx.jar`
   - Start dashboard: `cd dashboard && npm run dev`
   - Open browser to http://localhost:3000

2. Load Demo Footage
   - Use sample footage from /dashboard/public/videos/
   - Or connect to live camera feed
   - Recommended: aerial footage with moving objects

3. Detection Demo
   - Show real-time object detection with bounding boxes
   - Highlight confidence scores and class labels
   - Demonstrate multi-object tracking

4. Tracking & Prediction
   - Enable Kalman filter tracking
   - Show trajectory prediction (5-10 frames ahead)
   - Visualize predicted path overlays

5. Telemetry Dashboard
   - Show real-time telemetry panel
   - Display FPS, detection count, confidence metrics
   - Show telemetry log with position and velocity data

6. Performance Metrics
   - Display processing latency
   - Show detection accuracy
   - Demonstrate system scalability

Key Features to Highlight:
--------------------------
✓ Real-time YOLO object detection
✓ Kalman filter-based tracking
✓ Trajectory prediction algorithm
✓ WebSocket telemetry streaming
✓ Live dashboard visualization
✓ HUD overlay rendering
✓ ONNX model inference (Java)

Demo Tips:
----------
- Use high-quality footage with clear objects
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Test with various object types
- Prepare backup footage in case of issues
- Have screenshots ready for presentation

Expected Results:
-----------------
- Detection FPS: 30-60 fps
- Tracking accuracy: >90%
- Prediction horizon: 5-10 frames
- Latency: <50ms end-to-end
